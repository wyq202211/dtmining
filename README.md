The data is the wargame simulation result of 10 configurations of MAMS organization which are mentioned in the appendix. The abbreviations represent the strike performance, various aircraft consumptions, and mount consumptions.
After implicitly colrrelating with the capability configuration and MAMS organization features of different configurations, and processed by the proposed FCIM algorithm, the FCIs could be derived according to the set threshold. Notably, the data of winning scenarios(depicted by 6152 and 6153, implying the target ship is damaged or failed) and losing scenarios (depicted by 6150, implying the target ship remains normal) are processed seperatedly. First, the data should be transfered into the item-based form via backage1. Then the data will be processed by the proposed algorithm. After that, the results are further filtered to get the FCIs with strike performance, aircraft consumptions, and mount consumptions simultaneously. On this basis, some unimportant itemsets without enough information will be discarded by the third backage.
